This was a project created to test programatically committing a file.
By using one of the offline versions, I can commit a dummy text file to a fork of this repo.

These offline programs use various pygame-based modules to create a text input for the filename of the dummy text file.
I also attempted to use pygbag to deploy this test online. This didn't work because PyGithub is not supported by pygbag.

Future use of this idea will have to be offline or in a different programming language.
When I have time, and more experience to back up my judgements, I'd also consider asking PyGithub to be added to pygbag.
